public class Datatypes {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
    /* Different Data types
    int
    string 
    long
    float
    double
    
    
    to declare a varible u must specify the data type first then give name of the variab;e
    example: int myAge = 23; (since 23 is a number i use int and i dont use quotation marks around 23)

    to declare a constant we must use the keyword final and all letters are capitalized

    final int myAge = 23;

    final double PI = 3.1245

    LEARN JAVA: MANIPULATING VARIABLES
Review
What’s the use of having variables if you can’t do anything with them? We’ve now seen some ways you can operate on variables and compare them. The possibilities are endless!

We covered:

Addition and subtraction, using + and -
Multiplication and division, using * and /
The modulo operator for finding remainders, %
Greater than, >, and less than, <
Equal to, ==, and not equal to, !=
Greater than or equal to, >=, and less than or equal to, <=
equals() for comparing Strings and other objects
Using + to concatenate Strings
Practice some of these concepts here, to make sure you have a solid foundation for learning more complicated and exciting Java concepts!
